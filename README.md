## 🛒 Project Description
This is a simple e-commerce cart web application built using the MERN stack as part of my academic assignment.  
It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, edit or remove items, and proceed to checkout.  
The backend uses a temporary in-memory store (no database) for demonstration, but it can easily be extended to MongoDB.  

**Key Features:**
- Display product listings  
- Add, remove, and update cart items  
- Checkout form with customer details  
- API-based frontend–backend integration  
- Modular and clean code structure
